          <h3>Record your own version!</h3>
          <p>You can finally record your own version of John Cage's avant garde hit, Four Minutes
            and thirty-three seconds.</p>

          <h4>First we must go over some Rules</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>You cannot play any instruments</li>
            <li>You cannot talk</li>
            <li>You cannot sing</li>
            <li>Don't make any noise</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Now that we have those out of the way we must
            accomplish one more step to ready our ears for the process we
            are about to go about.</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>
            “nothing is accomplished by writing a piece of music
            nothing is accomplished by hearing a piece of music
            nothing is accomplished by playing a piece of music
            our ears are now in excellent condition.” 

            ― John Cage, Silence: Lectures and Writings
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>If you are detected not following these rules, you will be forced to
            restart your session.</p>

          <p>You need not be afraid to upload your performance for John Cage himself
          was quite aware of the abundance of emotions waiting for him.</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>
            The emotions - love, mirth, the heroic, wonder, tranquility, fear, anger, sorrow, disgust - are in the audience.
            ― John Cage, Silence: Lectures and Writings
            </p>
          </blockquote>



          <p>The intention of this project is very much in line with the original
            intentions of the original composer. To broaden what we view as art/music.</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>
          “Which is more musical, a truck passing by a factory or a truck
          passing by a music school?
          Are the people inside the school musical and the ones outside unmusical?
          What if the ones inside can't hear very well, would that change my question?” 
          ― John Cage, Silence: Lectures and Writings
            </p>
